            <h2>What is CSS?<em>And How Does It Relate to HMTL?</em></h2>
            
            <p><strong>CSS</strong> stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While <strong>HTML</strong> is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS.</p>
            <p id="first">Think of HTML as the foundation (every house has one), and CSS as the aesthetic choices (there’s a big difference between a Victorian mansion and a mid-century modern home).</p>

            <h2>How Does CSS Work?</h2>
            <p>CSS brings style to your web pages by interacting with HTML elements. Elements are the individual HTML components of a web page—for instance a paragraph—which in HTML might look like this:</p>
            <p>If you wanted to make this paragraph appear pink and bold to people viewing your web page through a web browser, you’d use CSS code that looks like this:

                p  {  color:pink;  font-weight:bold;  }</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>External, Internal, or Inline CSS?</h2>  
        <p>You might be wondering how this CSS code is actually applied to HTML content, though. Much like HTML, CSS is written in simple, plain text through a text editor or word processor on your computer, and there are three main ways to add that CSS code to your HTML pages. CSS code (or Style Sheets) can be external, internal, or inline. External style sheets are saved as .css files and can be used to determine the appearance of an entire website through one file (rather than adding individual instances of CSS code to every HTML element you want to adjust). In order to use an external style sheet, your .html files need to include a header section that links to the external style sheet and looks something like this:</p>
        <p>This will link the .html file to your external style sheet (in this case, mysitestyle.css), and all of the CSS instructions in that file will then apply to your linked .html pages.</p>
